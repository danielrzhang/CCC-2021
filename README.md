# CCC-2021
This repository contains my written, original solutions/attempted solutions for the CCC (Canadian Computing Contest) 2021.

# Notes
 - I wrote the Senior contest this year in Java 15 using Eclipse.
 - The S1 has floating point precision. Beware...
 - J5 = S2
 - For all of you TLEing on the J5/S2, you don't need a 2D array.
 - Partialed the S3 somehow. Don't ask.
 - Don't bother looking at my solutions for the S4 and S5. It's a dumpster mess.
 - J4 is unpog :((( (1 point for partial marks ~~***TRIGGERED***~~)
 - Apparently the J4 this year was very similar to last year's S4.
